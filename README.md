Captain Mumutara is a simple website featuring a fantasy character Captain Mumutara, a pirate Pig, the website consists of a home page, a secondary page linked to the first page with a brief history of Captain Mumutara and a form to subscribe for a monthly newsletter consisting of Captain Mumutara's adventures.

I made this website for my final project during my Harvard CS50B course where I had to make a website consisting of 2 or more pages with several CSS properties.

Here's the link to the website:

Hope you like it and find it amusing.
