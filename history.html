      History
    </h1>

    <h2>
      Captain Mumutara was once an ordinary farm pig until a fierce storm swept him away to the high seas, where fate transformed him into the most notorious pirate to sail the Seven Swills. With a sharp mind for strategy and an even sharper tusk, Captain Mumutara quickly rose through the ranks of pirate legends, known for his daring raids and clever escapes. His ship, the Squealing Serpent, was feared across the oceans, as Mumutara and his loyal crew of outcast animals plundered treasure, always staying one step ahead of those who tried to capture him. Tales of his exploits spread far and wide, making Captain Mumutara not just a pirate, but a symbol of freedom and cunning on the open seas.
